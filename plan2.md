  plan2.md - Gap remediation tasks for Smart Fork Detection project

  CONTEXT:
  - plan.md tasks are all complete (23/23 MVP tasks)
  - This plan addresses gaps identified from PRD vs implementation comparison
  - Gaps discovered during validation testing on 2026-01-21

  STRUCTURE:
  - Each task has: category, description, steps array, priority, and passes boolean
  - priority: P0 = critical/blocking, P1 = high, P2 = medium, P3 = low
  - passes: false = task not yet completed
  - passes: true  = task completed and verified

  USAGE:
  - The ralph.sh automation loop reads this file via PROMPT.md
  - Claude picks the first task where passes is false
  - After completing a task, Claude updates passes to true

  CATEGORIES:
  - bugfix: Fixes for issues found during validation
  - enhancement: Improvements to existing functionality
  - integration: Connecting components that exist but aren't wired together
  - ux: User experience improvements
  - testing: Additional test coverage

  CHANGE LOG:
  - 2026-01-21: Created plan2.md based on PRD gap analysis

# Smart Fork Detection - Gap Remediation Plan (Phase 2)

## Overview
This plan addresses gaps identified between the PRD specification and current implementation. All MVP tasks from plan.md are complete, but validation testing revealed several integration issues and missing UX features.

**Reference:**
- [PRD-Smart-Fork-Detection-2026-01-20.md](PRD-Smart-Fork-Detection-2026-01-20.md)
- [plan.md](plan.md) (Phase 1 - Complete)

**Validation Results:**
- 540 sessions successfully indexed
- Search returns relevant results
- Fork commands generate correctly
- Core architecture is solid (~80% MVP complete)

## Architecture Notes

The core architecture from plan.md remains unchanged. These tasks focus on:

1. **Integration gaps**: Components exist but aren't properly wired together
2. **UX polish**: Progress indicators, error handling, user feedback
3. **Robustness**: Timeout handling, graceful interruption, resume capability

```
Current State:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

- [ ] Initial setup shows progress: "Indexing session X of Y (Z%)"
- [ ] MCP tools can be invoked from Claude Code
- [ ] New session files are automatically indexed within 10 seconds
- [ ] Selection UI presents 5 options with recommended badge
- [ ] Memory markers boost session rankings correctly
- [ ] Setup can be interrupted and resumed without data loss
- [ ] Large sessions timeout gracefully instead of hanging
- [ ] All error states have helpful user-facing messages

---

## Validation Fixes Already Applied

The following issues were discovered and fixed during validation testing:

1. **Session parser nested message handling** (session_parser.py:231-232)
   - Issue: Parser didn't handle Claude Code's nested `message.role` and `message.content` structure
   - Fix: Added proper nested dict handling with content extraction

2. **Missing einops dependency** (pyproject.toml)
   - Issue: nomic-embed-text model requires einops package
   - Fix: Added `einops>=0.7.0` to dependencies

3. **Datetime serialization** (initial_setup.py:271)
   - Issue: datetime objects passed to SessionMetadata instead of ISO strings
   - Fix: Convert datetime to `.isoformat()` before storing

## Estimated Effort

| Priority | Tasks | Est. Complexity |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| P1 | 4 tasks | Medium |
| P2 | 5 tasks | Medium-High |
| P3 | 2 tasks | Low |

**Total: 11 tasks**

---

## Notes

- Tasks are ordered by priority (P1 first, then P2, then P3)
- Each task should be completable in a single ralph.sh iteration
- Test validation should be run after completing all P1 tasks
- P2 and P3 tasks can be deferred to v1.1 if time constrained
