  activity2.md - Progress log for the Smart Fork Detection Phase 2 (Gap Remediation)

  PURPOSE:
  - Tracks what was accomplished in each Phase 2 task iteration
  - Provides context for the next iteration of the ralph.sh loop
  - Serves as a human-readable audit trail of the remediation process

  USAGE:
  - Claude reads this file first to understand recent progress
  - After completing a task, Claude appends a dated entry
  - The "Current Status" section is updated to reflect progress

  CHANGE LOG:
  - 2026-01-21: Phase 2 initialized with 11 tasks from PRD gap analysis

# Project Build - Activity Log (Phase 2: Gap Remediation)

## Current Status
<!-- Updated after each task completion -->
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21 23:58
**Phase:** 2 (Gap Remediation)
**Tasks Completed:** 2/11
**Current Task:** Task 3 - Verify background indexer watchdog integration

---

## Phase 2 Context

### Validation Results (2026-01-21)
- **Sessions Indexed:** 540 of 746 (131 empty/skipped)
- **Search:** Working correctly
- **Fork Commands:** Generating correctly
- **Core Architecture:** ~80% MVP complete

### Fixes Applied During Validation
These issues were discovered and fixed before Phase 2 started:

1. **Session Parser Nested Messages** (session_parser.py)
   - Issue: Parser didn't handle Claude Code's nested `message.role` and `message.content`
   - Fix: Added proper nested dict handling

2. **Missing einops Dependency** (pyproject.toml)
   - Issue: nomic-embed-text model requires einops package
   - Fix: Added `einops>=0.7.0` to dependencies

3. **Datetime Serialization** (initial_setup.py)
   - Issue: datetime objects passed to SessionMetadata instead of ISO strings
   - Fix: Convert datetime to `.isoformat()` before storing

### 2026-01-21 - Phase 2 Start

**Status:** Phase 2 initialized after validation testing

**Context:**
- Completed validation of Smart Fork MVP
- Indexed 540 sessions successfully
- Confirmed search and fork command generation working
- Identified 11 gaps between PRD and implementation

**Pre-work Completed:**
- Fixed session_parser.py nested message handling
- Added einops dependency to pyproject.toml
- Fixed datetime serialization in initial_setup.py
- Updated README.md with correct MCP configuration format
- Created plan2.md with prioritized gap remediation tasks

**Files Created:**
- `plan2.md` - 11 prioritized tasks for gap remediation
- `PROMPT2.md` - Instructions for ralph.sh Phase 2 loop
- `activity2.md` - This activity log

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Task 1: Add progress display to initial setup
- Implement "Indexing session X of Y..." progress output
- Add estimated time remaining

---

### 2026-01-21 23:45
**Task:** Add progress display to initial setup
**Priority:** P1

**Changes Made:**
- Added `default_progress_callback()` function to initial_setup.py
- Added `_format_time()` helper function for human-readable time display
- Added `_format_bytes()` helper function for file size display
- Modified `InitialSetup.__init__()` to use default progress callback when `show_progress=True`
- Added `show_progress` parameter to InitialSetup constructor
- Fixed timestamp handling to support both datetime objects and ISO strings
- Updated test_initial_setup.py to expect default callback behavior
- Created test_progress_display.py to verify progress formatting

**Verification:**
- All 37 existing tests pass in test_initial_setup.py
- New progress display test passes with all 5 tests
- Progress output shows:
  - "Indexing session X of Y (Z%)" with current filename
  - Elapsed time in human-readable format (e.g., "2m 30s")
  - Estimated time remaining
  - Completion message with summary
- Verification saved to: verification/phase2-task1-progress-display.txt

**Status:**
- Progress display now works out-of-the-box without requiring callback setup
- Users see real-time progress when running initial_setup.run_setup()
- Can be disabled with show_progress=False if needed
- Task marked as passes=true in plan2.md

**Next:**
- Task 2: Verify and fix MCP server tool registration

**Blockers:**
- None

---

### 2026-01-21 23:58
**Task:** Verify and fix MCP server tool registration
**Priority:** P1

**Changes Made:**
- Created `verify_mcp_tools.py` comprehensive verification script
- Tested all aspects of MCP server tool registration
- Verified protocol compliance (JSON-RPC 2.0, MCP 2024-11-05)
- Created detailed findings document

**Verification:**
- All 19 existing unit tests pass in tests/test_mcp_server.py
- All 6 verification tests pass in verify_mcp_tools.py
- Verification results saved to: verification/phase2-task2-mcp-tool-verification.txt
- Detailed findings saved to: verification/phase2-task2-findings.md

**Status:**
- MCP server is correctly configured and functional
- `fork-detect` tool is properly registered and exposed
- Tool responds correctly to `tools/list` requests
- Tool invocation via `tools/call` works correctly
- Error handling is proper and follows MCP spec
- All response formats match MCP specification
- Task marked as passes=true in plan2.md

**Findings:**
- Server initialization: ✓ Working
- Tool registration: ✓ fork-detect properly registered
- Protocol compliance: ✓ JSON-RPC 2.0 + MCP 2024-11-05
- Tool invocation: ✓ Returns proper response format
- Error handling: ✓ Graceful handling of invalid requests
- Minor documentation issue identified (how MCP tools are invoked) - will be addressed in Task 11

**Next:**
- Task 3: Verify background indexer watchdog integration

**Blockers:**
- None
