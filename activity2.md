# Project Build - Activity Log (Phase 2: Gap Remediation)

## Current Status
<!-- Updated after each task completion -->
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21 12:00
**Phase:** 2 (Gap Remediation) - COMPLETE
**Tasks Completed:** 11/11 ✓
**Current Task:** All tasks completed

## Phase 2 Context

### Validation Results (2026-01-21)
- **Sessions Indexed:** 540 of 746 (131 empty/skipped)
- **Search:** Working correctly
- **Fork Commands:** Generating correctly
- **Core Architecture:** ~80% MVP complete

### Fixes Applied During Validation
These issues were discovered and fixed before Phase 2 started:

1. **Session Parser Nested Messages** (session_parser.py)
   - Issue: Parser didn't handle Claude Code's nested `message.role` and `message.content`
   - Fix: Added proper nested dict handling

2. **Missing einops Dependency** (pyproject.toml)
   - Issue: nomic-embed-text model requires einops package
   - Fix: Added `einops>=0.7.0` to dependencies

3. **Datetime Serialization** (initial_setup.py)
   - Issue: datetime objects passed to SessionMetadata instead of ISO strings
   - Fix: Convert datetime to `.isoformat()` before storing
