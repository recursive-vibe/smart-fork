- Whether you'd be willing to implement it

### 3. Submit Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. Fork the repository and create a feature branch

#### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Smart-Fork.git
cd Smart-Fork

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

#### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Write clean, documented code following existing patterns
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
5. Update documentation as needed (README.md, docstrings)
6. Commit with clear, descriptive messages

#### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for public methods
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex logic

#### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error handling

#### Submitting

1. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
2. Open a pull request against `main`
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Link related issues
5. Wait for review and address feedback

### 4. Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:
- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples or usage scenarios
- Improve installation instructions
- Write tutorials or guides

### 5. Help Others

- Answer questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/austinwentzel/Smart-Fork/discussions)
- Help triage and reproduce issues

- Share your Smart Fork setup and tips

## Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- Performance optimizations for large session databases
- Additional embedding model support
- UI/UX improvements for search results
- Integration with more IDEs/editors
- Better error messages and debugging tools

- Browser extension for web-based Claude
- Mobile app for searching sessions on the go

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Always start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Make changes, add tests
# ...

# Run tests locally
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: description"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature
```
